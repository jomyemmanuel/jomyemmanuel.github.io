Yoo!! Its 2017! An awesome year with awesome things to do. I have loads of things in my mind.

Starting off, I am going to start writing blogs. Contributing code to the open source world is something I am passionate about and hence I am looking forward to that too. I am also planning to solve at least 3 [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/) problems a week. I am also looking forward to reading plenty of good books this year. 2017 is also my graduation year. Ahh, good college memories :) Well, after I move to my workplace, I also plan to explore different places as well as be good in at least one sport. So, these are my goals for this year. I hope to achieve them all. Cheers!
